This is a notebook for practice code from R for Data Science (Hadley Wickham)

## Data Visualization

```{r}
library (tidyverse)
library(c("nycflights13", "gapminder", "Lahman"))
```

### Making ggplot2 graphs 

The basic form of a ggplot2 call is the following:
```{r}
 ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```
 
 
 This is a basic example of a plot from ggplot2
 
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg) + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy))
```


Additional aesthetic features can be added to convey more informaion. For example, to see the classes of cars, you can add the color information to the `aes` component..

```{r}

ggplot(data=mpg) + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy, color=class))

```

Now, each class has a unique color associated with it. This is called **scaling**.
